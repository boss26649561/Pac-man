# Pac-man Python
Pac-man game written in python for a group based university project. There are only 2 mazes available, game ends once all pellets are eaten.
Project was originally planned to be written in react but was switched to python due to group members not knowing react and javascript. Branch 2 has the react pacman prototype.

All code was still written by Guan-Tse Wu.
